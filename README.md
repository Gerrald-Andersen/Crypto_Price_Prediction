# üìà Crypto Price Prediction Dashboard

## üß≠ Purpose

This application was developed to assist cryptocurrency traders‚Äîparticularly Bitcoin enthusiasts‚Äîin making more informed trading decisions. By providing real-time price visualization and predictive insights, the dashboard aims to help users anticipate market movements and minimize potential losses. While not a substitute for financial advice, it offers a data-driven perspective that can complement trading strategies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I Did

The development process involved several key stages:
1. **Task Plan**
   - Before initiating the project, I carefully outlined a task plan to ensure clarity, focus, and efficiency throughout the development process. The goal was to build a predictive dashboard that could assist crypto traders in making smarter decisions.

2. **Data Collection**  
   - Fetched real-time Bitcoin market data from the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api), including OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close), volume, and market capitalization.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Processed raw data and created additional indicators such as VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) and VPT (Volume Price Trend) to enrich the dataset.

4. **Model Development**  
   - Built a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to predict future Bitcoin prices based on historical patterns.
   - Hyperparameter tuning was deferred due to computational cost constraints.

5. **Web Application Deployment**  
   - Developed an interactive dashboard using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to visualize price trends, display predictions, and allow real-time interaction with the data.

## üìä Results

Although the LSTM model does not yet produce highly accurate predictions, the project successfully demonstrates the integration of deep learning with live crypto data. More importantly, it has been a rich learning experience, allowing me to explore:

- Time series modeling
- API integration and data pipelines
- Feature engineering for financial data
- Streamlit-based UI development
- Model deployment and performance monitoring

The dashboard provides a functional base that can be expanded and refined over time.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include:

- **Model Tuning**  
  - Apply hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation to improve prediction accuracy.

- **Expanded Feature Set**  
  - Integrate additional technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) and external signals such as sentiment analysis.

- **Multi-Currency Support**  
  - Extend the dashboard to support other cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin.

- **Cloud Deployment**  
  - Host the application on a scalable cloud platform for broader accessibility and real-time performance.
